# AIWB (AI Workbench) ü§ñ

> Tired of one-shot AI prompts that miss the mark? Stop wrestling with single models. **Start orchestrating them.**

AIWB is a command-line toolkit for developers who want to elevate their AI-driven workflow. It introduces a powerful **Generator-Verifier** loop, turning a simple prompt into a sophisticated, multi-stage collaboration between different AI models.

## üí° The Core Concept: AI Collaboration

The magic of AIWB is its unique feedback loop. It mimics a professional developer and code reviewer team, resulting in higher-quality, refined output.

    subgraph AIWB Workflow
        A[User Prompt] --> B{Generator};
        B -- Drafts --> C[Code/Text Draft];
        C --> D{Verifier};
        D -- Critiques --> E[Feedback & Revisions];
        E --> F{AIWB Refines Prompt};
        F -- Instructs --> B;
    end
```

## ‚ú® Features at a Glance

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Repo Integration** | **NEW!** Set AIWB's context to an existing Git repository to have the AI edit, debug, and refactor your files directly. |
| **Hybrid AI Engine** | Go beyond single-model prompting. Our unique Generator-Verifier loop uses multiple AIs to create, critique, and improve work autonomously. |
| **Smart Cost Control** | Never get a surprise API bill again. The `gpre` and `quote` commands provide detailed, tiered cost estimates *before* you run anything. |
| **Streamlined Workflow** | A full suite of CLI tools (`pset`, `tnew`, `tedit`) lets you manage your projects and tasks without ever leaving the terminal. |
| **Built for the Command Line** | A fast, keyboard-driven interface designed for power users on Linux and Termux. |
| **Open & Extensible** | Easily add new models, including your own local LLMs running on Ollama or other servers. |

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

We're on a mission to build the ultimate command-line AI assistant. Join us!

* **Phase 1:** Consolidate core scripts, create a robust installer, and implement direct file editing within project contexts.
* **Phase 2:** Add support for more models (OpenAI, Ollama), integrate Git for auto-commits, and build an interactive TUI.
* **Phase 3:** Launch the "Autonomous Agent" that can run the refinement loop independently and perform file system operations.

For more details, see the [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) file.
