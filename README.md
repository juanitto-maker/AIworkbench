# AIWB (AI Workbench) ü§ñ

> Tired of one-shot AI prompts that miss the mark? Stop wrestling with single models. **Start orchestrating them.**

AIWB is a command-line toolkit for developers who want to elevate their AI-driven workflow. It introduces a powerful **Generator-Verifier** loop, turning a simple prompt into a sophisticated, multi-stage collaboration between different AI models.

## üí° The Core Concept: AI Collaboration

The magic of AIWB is its unique feedback loop. It mimics a professional developer and code reviewer team, resulting in higher-quality, refined output.

graph TD
    A[User Prompt] --> B(AI-Driven Workflow);
    B --> C[Generator];
    C --> D{Verifier};
    D -- Yes --> E(Refined Prompt);
    D -- No --> C;
    E --> F[Output];

## ‚ú® Features at a Glance

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hybrid AI Engine** | Go beyond single-model prompting. Our unique Generator-Verifier loop uses multiple AIs to create, critique, and improve work autonomously. |
| **Smart Cost Control** | Never get a surprise API bill again. The `gpre` and `quote` commands provide detailed, tiered cost estimates *before* you run anything. |
| **Streamlined Workflow** | A full suite of CLI tools (`pset`, `tnew`, `tedit`) lets you manage your projects and tasks without ever leaving the terminal. |
| **Built for the Command Line** | A fast, keyboard-driven interface designed for power users on Linux and Termux. |
| **Open & Extensible** | Easily add new models, including your own local LLMs running on Ollama or other servers. |

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

This project is just getting started. We're on a mission to build the ultimate command-line AI assistant. Join us!

* **üí° Phase 1:** Consolidate core scripts, create a robust installer, and ensure full Linux compatibility.
* **üí° Phase 2:** Add support for more models (OpenAI, Ollama), integrate Git for auto-commits, and build an interactive TUI.
* **üí° Phase 3:** Launch the "Autonomous Agent" that can run the refinement loop independently and perform file system operations.

For a more detailed breakdown of our future plans and milestones, see the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) file.
