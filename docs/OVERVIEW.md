# AIWB: Overview and Design Philosophy

This document provides a high-level overview of the AI Workbench (AIWB) project, its core design principles, and the philosophy behind its development.

## What is AIWB?

AIWB is a command-line interface (CLI) framework designed to streamline and enhance AI-assisted development workflows. It acts as an intelligent orchestrator, enabling developers to leverage multiple large language models (LLMs) in a structured, iterative manner directly from their terminal.

Unlike tools that offer simple, one-shot AI prompts, AIWB focuses on **process, iteration, and collaboration between AIs**, aiming to produce higher-quality, more reliable outputs.

## Core Design Principles

1.  **Hybrid Intelligence:**
    * **Concept:** No single AI model is perfect for every task. AIWB's core philosophy is to combine the strengths of different models (e.g., one for generation, another for verification) to create a more robust and self-correcting system.
    * **Benefit:** Reduces hallucinations, improves code quality, and allows for more complex problem-solving.

2.  **Developer-Centric CLI Experience:**
    * **Concept:** Developers spend a significant amount of time in the terminal. AIWB is built from the ground up to integrate seamlessly into this environment, offering a fast, keyboard-driven workflow.
    * **Benefit:** Minimizes context switching, enhances productivity, and appeals to power users.

3.  **Structured Workflow, Not Just Prompts:**
    * **Concept:** AIWB provides a scaffolded approach to AI tasks, including project management, task creation, and a clear lifecycle for AI interactions.
    * **Benefit:** Helps developers manage complex AI projects, ensures reproducibility, and makes it easier to onboard new contributors.

4.  **Cost Transparency & Control:**
    * **Concept:** LLM API costs can quickly add up. AIWB provides detailed pre-flight cost estimations and usage tracking.
    * **Benefit:** Enables developers to manage their budget effectively and make informed decisions about model usage.

5.  **Extensibility & Modularity:**
    * **Concept:** The AI landscape is rapidly evolving. AIWB is designed with a modular architecture that makes it easy to add new AI models, integrate with other tools, and extend functionality.
    * **Benefit:** Future-proofs the project and allows the community to contribute new integrations.

## The AIWB Workflow Philosophy

The AIWB workflow is based on a continuous loop of creation and refinement:

1.  **Define:** Clearly articulate the task with a well-crafted prompt.
2.  **Estimate:** Understand the potential cost and complexity before execution.
3.  **Generate:** Let the primary AI model produce a draft.
4.  **Verify:** Engage a secondary AI model to critically review and provide feedback on the draft.
5.  **Iterate:** Use the feedback to refine the prompt and re-engage the generator, closing the loop until the desired quality is achieved.

This iterative approach is key to unlocking the full potential of large language models for complex development tasks.

## Technology Stack

AIWB is primarily built using:
* **Bash Scripting:** For its ubiquity, power, and seamless integration with the command line.
* **`jq`:** For robust JSON parsing and manipulation, essential for interacting with AI APIs.
* **`curl`:** For making HTTP requests to various AI API endpoints.
