## Core Concepts

### Projects

Projects in AIWB serve as containers for related tasks. You can switch between projects, and all tasks created will belong to the currently active project.

* **Setting a Project:**
    ```bash
    pset <project-name>
    ```
    This command creates a new project directory (if it doesn't exist) and sets it as the active project.

### Tasks

Tasks are the fundamental units of work in AIWB. Each task typically corresponds to a specific prompt, an AI generation, and its subsequent review and refinement.

* **Creating a New Task:**
    ```bash
    tnew <task-id>
    ```
    This creates a new directory for the task within the active project and sets up initial files like `prompt.md`.

### `pset` - Project Set

**Description:** Creates and selects a new AIWB project. If the project already exists, it simply selects it.
**Usage:** `pset <project-name>`
**Example:**
```bash
pset my-first-project
# Output: âœ… Project selected: my-first-project
